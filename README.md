# Credit-EDA
This project carries out an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of credit application 
datasets to determine the most significant factors affecting loan approvals and defaults. 
The analysis involves rigorous data cleaning, missing value handling, feature engineering, 
and univariate/bivariate/multivariate analysis. Data based on income, credit history, 
occupation, age, and demographics are analyzed to reveal patterns regarding customer 
behavior. The outcomes form a solid basis for credit risk modeling, enabling financial 
institutions to effectively evaluate applicants and minimise default risk. 

# Objective 
1. To preprocess and clean the credit application dataset by addressing missing 
values, duplicates, and inconsistencies. 
2. To conduct univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis to derive insights into 
variable relationships. 
3. To segment applicants by age, credit amount, and occupation to assess risk. 
4. To model the influence of income, credit history, and external scores on loan 
approval. 
5. To combine application and prior application datasets to create richer insights 
into applicants’ credit behavior. 
6. In order to determine what distinguishes defaulters from non-defaulters.
